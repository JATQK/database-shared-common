= GitLotus component -- Shared package for handling database operations

This component is required for compiling https://github.com/git2RDFLab/ccr-worker-prototype/[ccr-worker-prototype], https://github.com/git2RDFLab/sparql-query-prototype/[sparql-query-prototype], and https://github.com/git2RDFLab/ccr-listener-prototype/[ccr-listener-prototype].

To remove duplicate database https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa[JPA] definitions, this shared database commons project was introduced, which is used in all projects, that share the mentioned JPA entities and logic.

To make the dependency locally, you have to pull this repository and install the https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] artifact locally, so the dependency is available for other projects.

[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:git2RDFLab/database-shared-common.git
cd database-shared-common
mvn clean install
----

The database shared common dependency is already included in https://github.com/git2RDFLab/ccr-worker-prototype/[ccr-worker-prototype], https://github.com/git2RDFLab/sparql-query-prototype/[sparql-query-prototype], and https://github.com/git2RDFLab/ccr-listener-prototype/[ccr-listener-prototype] as a dependency in the pom file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>de.leipzig.htwk.gitrdf.database</groupId>
	<artifactId>common</artifactId>
	<version>${de.leipzig.htwk.gitrdf.database.common.version}</version>
</dependency>

== Repository analysis
Each `GitRepositoryOrderEntity` can be linked to a `RepositoryAnalysisEntity` capturing the analysis metadata and the results of multiple LLM rating runs. A single analysis may hold aggregated ratings (`ratingNumber` or `ratingText`) and maintains several `LlmRatingRunEntity` objects. Each run stores its RDF output in the associated `LlmRatingRunEntityLobs` entry.
